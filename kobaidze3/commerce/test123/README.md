# Navigate to the kobaidze3/commerce/test123 directory
cd kobaidze3/commerce/test123

# Create the README.md file with the specified content
echo "This is a test123 folder." > README.md
```

Since the task is to create a file with specific content, the above steps will ensure that the file is created correctly with the required content. The code provided is a shell command sequence to achieve the desired result. However, if we are to write this in a script or directly as a file content, it would look like this:

Code:
```
# kobaidze3/commerce/test123/README.md
This is a test123 folder.
